Hi there, I'm Orest ! 
I'm a first-year Informatics student at the Faculty of Natural Sciences in Tirana.  My journey into the world of software development has just begun, and I'm eager to dive deeper into coding, algorithms, and problem-solving. 

 I love experimenting with small projects to sharpen my skills and bring creative ideas to life. Whether it's C programming,JAVA or C++  I’m always excited to learn new things and improve my craft. 

 In addition to software development, I'm fascinated by the world of computers and future technology. From building custom rigs to understanding the latest in tech innovations, I’m always keeping an eye on what’s next in the tech space. 

 I'm here to collaborate, learn, and contribute to exciting projects. Feel free to explore my repositories, and don't hesitate to reach out if you'd like to connect or discuss tech!
